        "# Understanding Regression and Classification: The Two Pillars of Supervised Machine Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "In supervised machine learning, we teach algorithms to learn from labeled data, aiming to make predictions or classifications on new, unseen data. There are two main types of tasks we can tackle:\n",
        "\n",
        "## Regression\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Goal: Predict a continuous numerical value. Think of it like estimating a number on a scale.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Examples:\n",
        "  * Predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and location.\n",
        "  * Forecasting stock prices based on historical trends and financial indicators.\n",
        "  * Estimating crop yields based on weather conditions and soil quality.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Models:**\n",
        "  * Linear Regression\n",
        "  * Polynomial Regression\n",
        "  * Decision Tree Regression\n",
        "  * Random Forest Regression\n",
        "  * Support Vector Regression (SVR)  \n",
        "  * Neural Networks (for more complex relationships)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Classification\n",
        "  \n",
        "  Goal: Predict a category or class label. Think of it like sorting items into different boxes.\n",
        "\n",
        "  Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Classifying emails as spam or not spam.\n",
        "  * Determining if a customer will churn (leave) based on their usage patterns.\n",
        "  * Identifying whether a tumor is malignant or benign from medical images.\n",
        "  \n",
        "**Models:**\n",
        "  * Logistic Regression\n",
        "  * Decision Tree Classifier\n",
        "  * Random Forest Classifier\n",
        "  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
        "  * Naive Bayes\n",

        "**Target Variable:**\n",
        "* Regression: Continuous numerical value (e.g., price, temperature, salary)\n",
        "* Classification: Categorical label (e.g., spam/not spam, red/green/blue, yes/no)\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Output:**\n",
        "* Regression: Predicted numerical value\n",
        "* Classification: Predicted class label or probability of belonging to each class\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Types:**\n",
        "* Regression: Linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regression, etc.\n",
        "* Classification: Logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest classifier, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation Metrics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regression: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc.\n",
        "* Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC curve, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Regression: Predict or forecast a numerical outcome based on input features.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Classification: Assign data points to predefined categories or classes based on their characteristics.\n",

        "\n",
        "**Which One to Use?**\n",
        "\n",
        "The choice between regression and classification depends on the type of problem you're trying to solve. If your goal is to predict a number, go with regression. If you want to categorize or label something, use classification.\n",
        "Important\n",
